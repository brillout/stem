      <h2>Launch. Today.</h2>
      <p>Choose your stack, run <code>$ npm create stem</code>, and start deploying to production. Today.</p>
      <p>
        Getting started has never been easier.
      </p>

      <h2 id="scalable">Yet, it is flexible.</h2>
      <p>Frameworks are rigid: after a certain point, as you scale, you end up spending more time fighting the framework than the time it saved you.</p>
      <p>Stem is different: integrations are ejactable</p>
      <p>
        For example, if you eject <code>stem-nodemailer</code> then you have full control over the emailing integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can even eject <code>stem-react</code> to completely control how React is integrated with the rest
        of your stack.
      </p>
      <p>As your project scales, and the need for custom integration arises, you eject the integrations
        you need to control.</p>
      <p>
        The best part is that integrations are only few lines of code:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>$ npm run eject stem-nodemailer</code> adds only <code>152</code> lines of code to your source code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>$ npm run eject stem-react</code> adds only <code>384</code> lines of code to your source code.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2 id="flexiblity-without-compromise">Truly flexible</h2>
      <p>
        Stem is only a collection of integrations: if you eject all of your
        <code>stem-*</code> packages, then you completely remove Stem. At that point, you are left with
        do-one-thing-do-it-well tools and have full control over how these tools integrate with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Stem, you can get all the control you need. Without compromise.
      </p>


      <h2 id="zero-magic">No magic</h2>
      <p>Stem may seem magical &mdash; it isn&#39;t.</p>
      <p>
        Integrations use a set of open standards enabling interoperability.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&#39;s why,
        for example, you can replace <code>stem-sqlite</code> with <code>stem-postgresql</code> in a seamless fashion:
        your other Stem integraions work just like before. (For example, Stem authentication integrations such as
        <code>stem-nextauth</code> communicate with the database using standarized CRUD database-agnostic operations.)
      </p>

      <h2 id="simplity">Simple</h2>
      <p>Everything we do is done with meticulous care for simplicity.</p>
      <p>
        Stem integrations are simple. Our recommended stacks are simple. Our do-one-thing-do-it-well tools are simple.
      </p>
      <p>If you care about simplicity (and you should!) then you&#39;ll feel right at home.</p>

      <h2 id="open">Open</h2>
      <p>
        Integrations are based on a open standard: there is no proprietary lock-in.
      </p>
      <p>Stem is decentral: each <code>stem-*</code> package can be developed independently of each other.</p>
      <p>
        Actually, if you re-publish <code>stem-*</code> packages under another name, then you essentially clone the Stem
        project.
      </p>
      <p>Stem is, at its core, open and collaborative.</p>
