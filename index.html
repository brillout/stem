      <h2>Quick start</h2>
      <p>Assemble your stack simply by picking `stem-*` packages.</p>

      <p>
        <button>React + Authentication + Emailing + SQLite + Vercel + PlanetScale</button>
      </p>

      <p>
        <button>React + Authentication + Emailing + SQLite + Vercel + PlanetScale</button>
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only that, but we also guide you to choose simple and effective stacks. For example, check "[WARNING-ICON]
        Warning" when selecting this stack: <button>React + SSR + GraphQL</button>.
      </p>

      <p>Get started with a all-included fully functional app with a "[CHECKMARK-ICON] Stem Approved" stack today.</p>

      <h2 id="scalable">Scalable</h2>
      <p>Every integration is ejectable.</p>
      <p>
        This means that, as your project scales and the need for custom integrations arise, you eject the integrations
        you need control over with.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you eject <code>stem-nodemailer</code> then you have full control over the emailing integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can even eject <code>stem-react</code> then you have full control over how React is integrated with the rest
        of your stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best part is that Stem integrations are only few lines of code. For example, if you eject
        <code>stem-nodemailer</code> then you end up with only an additional of [NUMBER] lines of code, for
        <code>stem-react</code> it&#39;s only [NUMBER].
      </p>
      <h2 id="flexiblity-without-compromise">Flexiblity, without compromise</h2>
      <p>
        Stem is only a collection of <code>stem-*</code> packages and, if you eject all of your
        <code>stem-*</code> packages, then you essentially remove Stem. At that point you are left with
        do-one-thing-do-it-well tools and have complete control over how these tools integrate with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which means that Stem is the most flexible framework out there, while also being the most full-fledged
        zero-config and easiest framework to get started with.
      </p>
      <p>Use Stem to get started quickly, while preservering flexibiliy. Without compromise.</p>
      <h2 id="zero-magic">Zero magic</h2>
      <p>Stem may seem magical at first &mdash; but it isn&#39;t.</p>
      <p>
        Integrations use a set of open standards (JavaScript Open Standards) enabling interoperability. That&#39;s why,
        for example, you can replace <code>stem-sqlite</code> with <code>stem-postgresql</code> in a seamless fashion:
        your other Stem integraions work just like before. (For example, Stem authentication integrations such as
        <code>stem-nextauth</code> communicate with the database using standarized CRUD database-agnostic operations.)
      </p>
      <h2 id="simplity">Simplity</h2>
      <p>Everything we do is done with meticulous care for simplicity.</p>
      <p>
        Stem integrations are simple. Our recommended stacks are simple. Our do-one-thing-do-it-well tools are simple.
      </p>
      <p>If you care about simplicity (and you should!) then you&#39;ll feel right at home.</p>
      <h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
      <p>
        The vision is to foster a flourishing ecosystem of integrations. You want tool X? Seamlessly add
        it to your stack by using its Stem integration.
      </p>
      <h2 id="open">Open</h2>
      <p>
        Integrations are based on a standard that is open (JavaScript Open Standards): there is no proprietary lock-in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, if you re-publish <code>stem-*</code> packages under another name, then you essentially clone the Stem
        project.
      </p>
      <p>We believe frameworks of the future to be open and collaborative.</p>
