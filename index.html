      <h2>Launch. Today.</h2>
      <p>Choose your stack, run <code>$ npm create stem</code>, and start deploying to production. Today.</p>
      <p>Getting started has never been easier.</p>

      <h2 id="scalable">Yet, it is flexible.</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional frameworks are rigid. After a certain point, as you scale, you end up spending more time fighting
        the framework than the time it saved you.
      </p>
      <p>Stem is different because integrations are ejectable.</p>
      <p>
        For example, if you eject <code>stem-nodemailer</code> then you have full control over the email integration.
        You can even eject <code>stem-react</code> and completely control how React is integrated with the rest of your
        stack. At that point, you can replace React with Vue.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your project scales, and the need for custom integration arises, you eject the integrations you need to
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        We keep integrations simple with only a few lines of code. For example,
        <code>$ npm run eject stem-nodemailer</code> adds only <code>152</code> lines of code to your source code, and
        <code>$ npm run eject stem-react</code> only adds <code>384</code> lines.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flexiblity-without-compromise">Truly flexible</h2>
      <p>
        Stem is only a collection of integrations: if you eject all of your
        <code>stem-*</code> packages, then you completely remove Stem, and you are left with do-one-thing-do-it-well
        tools with full control over how they integrate with each other.
      </p>
      <p>With Stem, you can get all the control you need. Without compromise.</p>

      <h2 id="zero-magic">No magic</h2>
      <p>Stem may seem magical &mdash; it isn&#39;t.</p>
      <p>Integrations use a set of open standards enabling interoperability.</p>
      <p>
        That&#39;s why, for example, you can replace <code>stem-sqlite</code> with <code>stem-postgresql</code> in a
        seamless way: your other integrations, such as your authentication integration, work just like before because
        they communicate with the database using an open standard that standarizes basic CRUD operations.
      </p>

      <h2 id="simplity">Simple</h2>
      <p>Everything we do is done with a meticulous care for simplicity.</p>
      <p>
        Stem integrations are simple. Our recommended stacks are simple. Our do-one-thing-do-it-well tools are simple.
      </p>
      <p>If you care about simplicity (and you should!) then you&#39;ll feel right at home.</p>

      <h2 id="open">Open</h2>
      <p>Integrations are based on open standards: there is no proprietary lock-in.</p>
      <p>
        Actually, if you re-publish <code>stem-*</code> packages under another name, then you essentially clone the Stem
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only that, but Stem is also decentral: <code>stem-*</code> package can be developed independently of each
        other.
      </p>
      <p>Stem is, at its core, open and collaborative.</p>
