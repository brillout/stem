# Stem

## Get started, today

Assemble your stack simply by picking `stem-*` packages.

<button>React + Authentication + Emailing + SQLite + Vercel + PlanetScale</button>

Not only that, but we also guide you to choose simple and effective stacks. For example, check "[WARNING-ICON] Stack Warning" when selecting this stack: <button>React + SSR + GraphQL</button>.

Get started with a all-included fully functional app with a "[CHECKMARK-ICON] Stem Approved" stack today.


## Scalable

Every integration is ejectable.

This means that, as your project scales and the need for custom integrations arise, you eject the integrations you need control over with.

For example, if you eject `stem-nodemailer` then you have full control over the emailing integration.

You can even eject `stem-react` then you have full control over how React is integrated with the rest of your stack.

The best part is that Stem integrations are only few lines of code. For example, if you eject `stem-nodemailer` then you end up with only an additional of [NUMBER] lines of code, for `stem-react` it's only [NUMBER].


## Flexiblity, without compromise

Stem is only a collection of `stem-*` packages and, if you eject all of your `stem-*` packages, then you essentially remove Stem. At that point you are left with do-one-thing-do-it-well tools and have complete control over how these tools integrate with each other.

Which means that Stem is the most flexible framework out there, while also being the most full-fledged zero-config and easiest framework to get started with.

Use Stem to get started quickly, while preservering flexibiliy. Without compromise.


## Zero magic

Stem may seem magical at first &mdash; but it isn't.

Integrations use a set of open standards (JavaScript Open Standards) enabling interoperability. That's why, for example, you can replace `stem-sqlite` with `stem-postgresql` in a seamless fashion: your other Stem integraions work just like before. (For example, Stem authentication integrations such as `stem-nextauth` communicate with the database using standarized CRUD database-agnostic operations.)



## Simplity

Everything we do is done with meticulous care for simplicity.

Stem integrations are simple. Our recommended stacks are simple. Our do-one-thing-do-it-well tools are simple.

If you care about simplicity (and you should!) then you'll feel right at home.


## Vision

The [vision]() is to foster a flourishing ecosystem of integrations. You want tool X? Seamlessly add it to your stack by using its Stem integration.


## Open

Integrations are based on a standard that is open (JavaScript Open Standards): there is no proprietary lock-in.

Actually, if you re-publish `stem-*` packages under another name, then you essentially clone the Stem project.

We believe frameworks of the future to be open and collaborative.
