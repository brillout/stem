      <p>
        We guide you to choose simple and effective stacks.

      <p>
        <button>React + Authentication + Emailing + SQLite + Vercel + PlanetScale</button>
      </p>

      <p>
        <button>React + Authentication + Emailing + SQLite + Vercel + PlanetScale</button>
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, check "[WARNING-ICON]
        Warning" when selecting this stack: <button>React + SSR + GraphQL</button>.
      </p>

      <p>Get started with a all-included fully functional app with a "[CHECKMARK-ICON] Stem Approved" stack today.</p>



      <p>
        Which means that Stem is the most flexible framework out there, while also being the most full-fledged
        zero-config and easiest framework to get started with.
      </p>
      <p>Use Stem to get started quickly, while preservering flexibiliy. Without compromise.</p>

      You get started while retaining control. You get the best of both words, without compromise.

      <h2 id="vision">The vision.</h2>
      <p>
        The vision is to foster a flourishing ecosystem of integrations. You want tool X? Seamlessly add
        it to your stack by using its Stem integration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frameworks lure you into proprietary lock-in. You get stuck with that framework and migrating away from the framework is mess and at scale becomes a serious business decision.
      </p>
      <p>
      With Stem, it's nothing like that.
